                        <li>Games are focused on campaign play which allows players to build unique scenarios.</li>
                        <li>NWG games prioritize efficient clever mechanics over long lists of modifiers and statistics.</li>
                        <li>Game play prioritizes the actions of individual men, women, and occasionally aliens over abstract military units in combat.</li>
                        <li>NWG is interested in supporting games in science fiction, fantasy, and a number of historical settings. No one setting is prioritized over another.</li>

                        <li>The FiveCore system underpins the FiveCore skirmish, Company Command and Brigade Commander rules as well as seeing use in Five Men at Kursk and FiveCore Pulp.</li>    
                        <li>The system is based on a “single-roll” mechanic where one roll of the dice provides all the information required, whether the target is damaged, out of action, pinned down or retreating.</li>
                        <li>FiveCore games never use chains of rolls with stacks of modifiers.</li>
                        <li>The rules are intended for campaign play, and also feature “rpg-like” advancement mechanics that allow you to develop individual characters through a series of battles.</li>

                        <li>In Sight is aimed at a “hard military” style of play, focused around controlling the battlefield through fields of fire.</li>    
                        <li>Players must manage the exhaustion of their commanders and judge when to hold ground and when to continue pushing forward.</li>
                        <li>The system is currently available in cold war (No End in Sight), scifi (No Stars in Sight) and post-apocalyptic (No Hope in Sight) versions.</li>

                    <li>The foundation of Starport Scum and Dungeon Scum is the Scum system, which uses simple dice pools with dirt-simple mechanics to play out exciting RPG/Wargame hybrid scenarios.</li>
                    <li>Follow your characters as they manage tactical encounters, switch to a fluid roleplaying scene, and then finish up by leveling up your characters.</li>
                    <li>These games are ideal for wargamers who want a little more character or roleplayers who like tactical action.</li>

                                    This brand new 3rd edition of the premier character-driven skirmish system will knock your socks off.
                                    FiveCore offers you fast playing games with 5-15 figures per side.
                                    There are No firing tables; players just roll the dice and know immediately if a target is down, wounded, pinned or running away.
                                    Troop quality affects your ability to coordinate attacks, and have your men work together, rather than just providing a +1 to hit.
                                    The turn sequence keeps you on your toes. You can always do something, but you can never do everything. Being able to adapt on the fly is key to success.

                                   Drawing on sources such as Traveller, Firefly, Trigun and Borderlands, it's a game about getting by on the outskirts of civilization, always on the look out for that next job.
                                    Combining miniatures war gaming with role playing game touches, Starport Scum is playable as a conventional miniatures game, a narrative RPG, or a hybrid beast combining the best of both worlds.

                                    The core combat rules use a dice pool system to deliver results very quickly. While the rules cover a variety of situations, the basics can be condensed down to one page and revolve around gathering up a base number of dice (based on character class), adding bonus dice for suitable traits and weapon tags. The only need for book keeping or markers during a game is for figures that are pinned down and wounded hero figures. Thus, you can avoid the table being cluttered with status effects.

                                The setting covers roughly a hundred years, starting with Napoleon and Washington, and ending as the old world romance dies in 1914. An army consists of 8-12 infantry units with a few supporting cavalry units and artillery units representing the entire army taking the field. This game is intended for 15mm figures and below, each unit consists of 4 stands (infantry/cavalry) or a single gun stand, meaning that a full army won't typically require more than 50 stands.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your troops will carry out basic movement and combat automatically, but you will have a limited number of rallying and shock actions each turn, based on unit quality and the luck of the Command Dice roll each turn.</li>
                                    <li>If you need additional actions, your army leadership can be committed to give you additional actions, but this puts them at risk. Lead from the front and be rewarded.. or shot from your horse.</li>
                                    <li>Combat uses a single-roll mechanic: Roll a pool of dice (typically 3-4) and check each die for results.</li>
                                    <li>The single roll will tell you everything you need to know, without any additional rolls required: Is the enemy in Disarray? Being pushed back? Taking losses? One roll decides.</li>
                                    <li>Finally the rules offer simple campaign rules, options to help you set up creative scenarios, and a standard "meeting engagement" battle plan you can use to set up.</li>
